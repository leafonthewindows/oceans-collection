## Challenges

This project has helped elucidate some of the difficulties web developers face in creating larger scale projects. The first key difficulty from this project was: to what extent should a framework be used. Bootstrap was helpful in a few key areas such as the navbar, alerts, and validation feedback. However, I found some difficulty deciding when to use the Bootstrap CSS elements rather than creating my own. This has instilled upon me the importance of knowing what you want from each tool and how much you will use it prior to adding its functionality into a project. The second difficulty was knowing when to decide the project was finished. The CSS styling of a project can be fiddled with long after the project looks complete. Knowing when to stop and what is not worth spending time on is an important skill in the fast paced world of web development. After completing this project, I feel more confident in knowing how to time manage on a variety of different tasks.
